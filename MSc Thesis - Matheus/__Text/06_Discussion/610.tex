Because visual blurring is a depth-dependent phenomenon, we would like to capture image and depth information from the environment and generate real-time simulations of how low-order aberrations affect visual  perception. Also, 
%we suppose that, by assuming 
we would like to include information about the absolute threshold in the simulation to improve its result. 
%In a way that, for example, we could generate images or design displays focusing on intrinsic perception, which cannot be corrected with ordinary eyeglasses.

%It would be interesting to study the best objective metric to compare results. Also, 
For a qualitative validation, it would be desirable to simulate the visual perception of a number of individuals who use eyeglasses. We could then ask these subjects to compare several scenes observed without their eyeglasses with the corresponding simulated views, this time with their eyeglasses on. Such an experiment could indicate how well the simulation approximates their actual vision.
