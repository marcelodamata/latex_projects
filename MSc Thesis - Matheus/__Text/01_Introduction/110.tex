The \textbf{contributions} of this thesis include:

\begin{itemize}

	\item A description of a technique for modeling and simulating visual aberrations. Although the technique itself is not novel, the detailed description presented here consolidates and clarifies information from various sources, providing a valuable resource for the research community;
	\item A DLSR camera-based approach to validate the visual simulation results;
	\item The design of a psychophysical experiment to estimate an individual's absolute threshold for vision;
	\item The design and construction of an apparatus to perform the referred psychophysical experiment.
	
\end{itemize}
