\label{chap:Introduction}

Vision is the primary channel we use to perceive the universe. Its unique capability allows us to acquire information about the surrounding world by sensing the intensity and color of light. This experience is unique and the perceived image is affected by several individual factors (\eg, refractive errors, light sensitivity, distribution of photoreceptors in the retina, etc.). Simulating visual experience is a complex and difficult task, which requires the integration of a wide range of fields, including optics, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, psychology, and cognitive neurosciences \cite{Schwartz2010}. 

Visual aberrations can be classified as low-order or high-order. Low-order aberrations (\ie, myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia) can be described in terms of sphero-cylindrical values and can be corrected with the use of eye glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery.  They are responsible for about 90\% of ones loss of visual acuity \cite{Dias2014}. The remaining 10\% is due to a combination of particular imperfections, known as high-order aberrations (\eg, trefoil, coma, quadrafoil, secondary astigmatism). Visual aberrations can be described by the eye's point-spread function (PSF), often represented using the so-called wavefront maps. Figure \ref{fig:eye_diagram} illustrates the human eye and the effects of some low-order aberrations when focusing at infinity.

The simulation of how an impaired eye perceives a scene is a complex, but highly important task. It could, for instance, give doctors an idea of how a given patient's vision was before and after some surgical procedure. It could also allow primary school teachers understand the complaints of their students. In practice, poor visual performance is often misinterpreted as the perception of blurry images. However, the problem is not that simple. Visual simulation is an intricate process that requires sophisticated tools of Fourier analysis~\cite{Thibos2011}. From a simple geometrical perspective, when the optical system of an eye is mis-focused at a point in the scene, the light emitted/reflected by such a point is spread out across some area (circle of confusion) of the retinal surface, causing blur. This can be understood from Figures \ref{fig:eye_diagram2} and \ref{fig:eye_diagram3}, and observed in Figure
%~\ref{fig:depthblur2} and 
\ref{fig:depthblur3}, which was captured using a myopic camera. Note that when the optical system is well focused (Figure \ref{fig:eye_diagram1}) a point on the scene is imaged to a point on the retina. 

Unlike traditional 2-D digital image processing in which an image is blurred by convolving it with a spatially-invariant low-pass filter kernel (Figure \ref{fig:depthblur2}), visual blurring is a depth-dependent phenomenon (\ie, the amount of blurring introduced by the eye's PSF varies with the distance from the observer's focal plane to the scene element). If depth is not taken into account by the blurring method, the resulting image might be very different from the one formed onto the retina --- Figure \ref{fig:depthblur3}.

%\citet{Barsky2004} has explored the problem of vision simulation considering depth information and the characteristics of a particular individual's optical system. However, his technique uses synthetic scenes, since depth information is easily available for them. Moreover, Barsky's approach relies on information acquired from a high-end Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing system (costing about USD 36,000.00). But there are plenty of other low-cost techniques to measure refractive conditions (concerning only low-order aberrations), such as the simple use of trial lenses in combination with Snellen charts, retinoscopy, auto-refractors, and others. Even though these methods do not provide the same accuracy compared with wavefront aberrometry, they are more accessible and cover most of the issues affecting people's visual acuity. 

We describe a practical approach to the simulation of visual low-order aberrations and it effects on the perception of monochromatic images placed at a known distance from the observer. The simulation is based on Fourier optics and its validation is performed using a DSLR camera.
%It relies on the assumption of a fixed depth and uses Fourier optics and a DSLR camera to simulate and validate results.
