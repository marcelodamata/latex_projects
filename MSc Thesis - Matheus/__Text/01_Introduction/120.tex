\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{sec:ThesisStructure}

The remaining of this thesis is organized as follows: Chapter~\ref{chap:Background} reviews the theoretical basis for the further anatomical, optical, and numerical discussions. Chapter~\ref{chap:RelatedWork} discusses previous visual simulation techniques, as well as methods for estimating optical aberrations. It also discusses simulation techniques that take non-optical characteristics into account. 
Chapter~\ref{chap:Methods} describes our approach for visual simulation of blur on monochromatic images. 
%Additionally, it explains how the technique can be combined with the minimum amount of light perceived by an individual. 
Chapter~\ref{chap:Results} presents a study about the absolute threshold for vision and an attempt to relate it with the spherical equivalent refraction. 
Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:Discussion} summarizes this thesis and suggests some ideas for future work.

%focused on statistically significant data and their limitations.
