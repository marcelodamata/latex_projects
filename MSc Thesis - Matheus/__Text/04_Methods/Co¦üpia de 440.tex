\label{sec:Validation}

To validate the visual simulation results of the refractive errors, we use DSLR camera (Canon model EOS Rebel T3 with 18-55mm lens). The camera represents a perfect eye (\ie without refractive aberrations). We place additional lenses in front of the camera's optical system to induce low-order aberrations (\ie, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism). Such lenses are placed on a support fixed to a UV filter attached to the main lens. Figure~\ref{fig:extralens} shows the camera with an external +1.0 diopter lens attached to it. The support can hold up to three additional lenses.

%results from the image filtering process, we've used additional lenses to induce low-order aberrations (\ie, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism) into the DSLR camera's optical system (Figure~\ref{fig:extralens}). 
We have also created a synthetic eye model and adjusted it according to the camera's configuration to achieve consistent results.

When comparing results, we make sure that the \emph{f-number} (\ie, the ratio of the lens' focal length $f$ to the diameter $D$ of the entrance pupil):

 4.5mm, 4.0mm and 3.6mm, respectively. 
Our synthetic eye model (Figure~\ref{fig:syntheticeye}) has a diameter of 18mm. Due to the presence of the crystalline lens,  its actual focal length of 13.5mm: $f_{eye} = 18mm \times \eta_{eye} =  18mm \times 1.333 = 13.5 mm$, where $\eta_{eye}$ is the index of refraction of the eye. As a result, for the simulations, the pupil size (equivalent of the camera's lens aperture) needs to be rescaled to maintain the same \emph{f-number} values as the camera. Table~\ref{table:pupildiameter} shows the corresponding values of the equivalent camera apertures and pupil diameters. The simulation results shown in \review{Chapter~\ref{chap:Results}} were obtained for $f/5.0$.

%we must rescale the entrance pupil's diameter (Table~\ref{table:pupildiameter}) in order to maintain the same \emph{f-number} in simulations of retinal images.
