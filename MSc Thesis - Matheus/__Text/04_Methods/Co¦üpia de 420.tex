\section{Modeling Visual Aberrations}
\label{sec:SpecifyingAberrations}

We characterize the optical aberrations of the human eye using a wavefront aberration function. Such a function defines a wavefront map, which is approximated using a series of polynomials, such as the Zernike polynomials (see Section \ref{subsec:VisualAberrations}). 
Obtaining a complete wavefront function, which models both low-order and high-order aberrations, requires access to expensive wavefront aberrometer devices. In this work, we only consider the low-order aberrations (\ie, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism), which can be easily obtained from any eyeglass or contact lens prescription. One should note, however, that low-order aberrations are responsible for about 90\% of one's total visual aberrations~\cite{Dias2014}. This should not come as a surprise, given that eyeglasses only correct for low-order aberrations and are the primary way of achieving corrected 20/20 vision. 
%As a complete wavefront map acquisition requires 
%is quite expensive and not accessible worldwide, 
We obtain wavefront aberration function $W_{(x,y)}$ from prescription data as~\cite{Dai2008}:
%to convert elementary information to wavefront maps: 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:W}
  W_{(x,y)} = \sum_{i=-1}^1 c_{2}^{2i} \, Z_{2}^{2i}_{(x,y)},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	\centering
	\label{eq:c2-2}
	c^{-2}_{2} = \frac{R^2*C*\sin(2\phi )}{4\sqrt{6}},
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
	\centering
	\label{eq:c20}
	c^{0}_{2} = - \frac{R^2 * (S + C/2))}{4\sqrt{3}}, 
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
	\centering
	\label{eq:c22}
	c^{2}_{2} = \frac{R^2*C*\cos(2\phi )}{4\sqrt{6}}
\end{equation}
\noindent
and 
$c^{-2}_{2}$, $c^{0}_{2}$, and $c^{2}_{2}$ are the coefficients of the Zernike polynomials corresponding to {\it oblique astigmatism} ($Z^{-2}_{2}$), {\it defocus} ($Z^{0}_{2}$), and {\it vertical astigmatism} ($Z^{2}_{2}$), respectively (see Figure~\ref{fig:zernike}).
$S$, and $C$ are respectively the {\it sphere} and {\it cylinder} values that specify the optical power in diopters (D).  $\phi$ is cylinder axis expressed in degrees. 
%Both $S$ and $C$ are in diopters, 
$R$ is the radius of the subject's pupil (an aperture, in general)  measured in mm, and $c^{-2}_{2}$, $c^{0}_{2}$ and $c^{2}_{2}$ are in $\mu$m. Figure~\ref{fig:wavefront} illustrates a wavefront map obtained for $S = 0.5$D, $C = -2.0$D, $\phi = 45^\circ$ and $R = 1.5$mm. If no aberration is present, the resulting wavefront is planar.
