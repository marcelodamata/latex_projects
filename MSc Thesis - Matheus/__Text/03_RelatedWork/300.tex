Vision simulation has been addressed in different ways over the years. Since 
%1981, when 
the first synthetic image with depth of field computed by \citet{Potmesil1981}, there has been a significant number of computer graphics techniques addressing the rendering of realistic effects. More recently, the possibility of estimating and compensating for refractive errors has attracted the attention of several researchers, mainly addressing the formulation of interactive, portable, and inexpensive solutions. The following subsections describe the main techniques for simulating, estimating, and correcting visual aberrations.
